## Avellaneda-Stoikov Market Making Model

Our model was primary inspired by the Avellaneda-Stoikov Market Making Model. This model works by finding an optimal reservation price (i.e. fair price we wish to trade our instrument), and optimal bid-ask spread (i.e. how wide of a spread we wish to market make).
